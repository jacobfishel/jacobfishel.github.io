### Crate-Dig - In progress
A fully vibe-coded application to showcase the use of using AI Driven Development to complete projects.
This project was built using cursor.

### Snake Game AI Reinforcement Learning
An AI-enhanced version of the classic Snake game implemented using Pygame and reinforcement learning. The project integrates game logic, agent behavior, and neural modeling to create an intelligent, self-learning player.

### Computer Vision:

### Dark-Hair-Detection:
This project uses OpenCV to recognize people with dark hair in the webcam feed and display the number on screen. 
This project looks at the shape, color, concavity, size, etc to analyze if a segment of the webcam feed is dark hair, an entry level way to detect how many people are in the webcam feed.

### Multi-Person-Detection:
a real-time computer vision system that detects, tracks, and classifies multiple people in a live video feed. The system combines OpenCV, YOLO-based object detection, SORT tracking, and MediaPipe Pose to deliver a complete pipeline for identity persistence and action classification.
