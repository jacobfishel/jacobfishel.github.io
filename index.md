### CPSC 120


* Lab 7


   Lab 7 was a favorite because this lab was very complex and useful. It was very difficult to get the correct outputs with all the conflicting street parking times. I was able to improve on comparison statements which were used to tell the user when parking was allowed on a particular street and day. This lab is also very useful because I often read street signs to see when I can park somewhere and it can be stressful when you are unsure.


* Lab 10


   This lab was very enjoyable and challenging. I think it's very interesting to be able to input a county and know the population of that county. This is something me and many others are often curious about and this lab can be expanded to states and countries. This lab helped me learn how to code with vectors.


* Lab 11


   This Lab was very challenging and created a fun product. The hi-lo game is a fun concept and I enjoyed being able to create a simple game through code. This lab helped me learn alot about classes and vectors.
